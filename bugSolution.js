The solution involves verifying the Expo CLI installation, checking your project dependencies, and ensuring correct project configuration. 

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Verify Expo CLI Installation:**
   ```bash
expo --version
```
   If the version is not displayed or you encounter an error, reinstall the CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`

2. **Check project dependencies:** 
   Make sure your project's `package.json` file correctly lists and installs `expo-constants` and other necessary packages: 
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "expo-constants": "^13.0.0" // Or the appropriate version
     }
   }
   ```
   Run `expo install expo-constants` to install or reinstall the dependency.

3. **Clear the cache:** Clear the Expo cache and npm cache to ensure no conflicting files are interfering with the process. `expo prebuild --clean` and `npm cache clean --force`

4. **Check your Expo project structure:** Ensure your project's structure is correctly set up and follows Expo guidelines. Review the official Expo documentation for project structure details.

5. **Restart your machine:** Sometimes a simple restart is the easiest solution!
